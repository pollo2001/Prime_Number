# Prime Number Calculator üßÆ

This project is an **ARM assembly-based** prime number calculator designed to find all prime numbers between two user-provided integers. It is optimized for **Cortex-A72** processors using **NEON SIMD** for faster calculations. The program asks for two integers as input and prints the prime numbers in that range.

---

## How It Works üöÄ

1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter two positive integers in the format `(int1, int2)` where `int1` is the starting number and `int2` is the ending number for the range to search for prime numbers.
   
2. **Prime Calculation**: 
   - The program uses an **optimized IIR filter** technique for efficient prime checking, iterating through numbers and checking divisibility.
   - It checks each number between `int1+1` and `int2` to determine whether it's prime by testing divisibility with numbers from `2` to `n/2`.

3. **Output**: The program then outputs all the prime numbers found in the range.

## Project Components üîß

- **Prime Checking Algorithm**: Uses **division** and **remainder** checking in assembly for high efficiency.
- **Optimized for Cortex-A72 & NEON**: Utilizes ARM's NEON SIMD instructions for performance optimization.
- **Input Handling**: User enters the range of numbers to check for primes.
- **Output**: Prime numbers within the range are printed on the screen.

## Requirements üì¶

- **Raspberry Pi** with a **Cortex-A72** CPU.
- **ARM Toolchain** (GCC for ARM).
- **libsndfile** for any potential audio output if needed (although it's not required for this specific version).
- **Assembler (`as`)** or **GCC** for compiling ARM assembly.

## Build Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prime-number-calculator.git
cd prime-number-calculator
```

### 2. Compile the project:

Make sure you have the ARM toolchain installed on your Raspberry Pi. If you're on **macOS**, you may need to use **Homebrew** to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
make
```

This will compile the assembly code into object files and link them into the final executable `find_prime`.

### 3. Run the program:

```bash
./find_prime
```

### 4. Enter your range of numbers:

The program will prompt you with:

```txt
Enter two positive integers in format: (int1, int2)
```

For example:

```txt
Enter two positive integers in format: (int1, int2)
```

If you input:

```txt
5, 30
```

### 5. View the output:

The program will output all prime numbers between 5 and 30, such as:

```txt
Prime numbers between 5 and 30 are:
5
7
11
13
17
19
23
29
```

### Clean up üßπ
To clean up the compiled files and reset the project:

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove all object files and the `find_prime` executable.
